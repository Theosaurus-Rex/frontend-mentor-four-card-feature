## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Adding a `border-top` to an element with a `border-radius` applied will also cause the border to appear curved. To get around this, I created psuedo elements with the `::before` selector and styled them with the colours to match the design, which has top border with a straight edge.
